# Landing Page from the Odin Project

## My recap

-   Finding and setting up a google font
-   Take a design file and code appropriate html for it
-   Transfer what I see from the design into appropriate css code
-   Use git to commit my code for every section of design I finished to have a proper log of my work
-   Played around with margin and padding to try and get the page close to the design as possible
-   Flexbox was used mostly postition the content around to match the design as close as possible
-   Found it more manageable to finish one part of the entire design instead of coding the entire html page first
